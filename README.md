# 100DaysofCode
### Code for at least an hour daily, share repos, record challenges to overcome them, and repeat the next day

## About
Inspired by Richard Littauer's [post](https://medium.com/@richlitt/100-days-of-code-5e9a4dc6d56b) and Jerry Seinfeld's productivity secret: "don't break the chain." I will code everyday, mainly completing course assignments initially, then eventually some cool web apps and my portfolio. I will chronicle the failures, small victories and even the mundane on my. The point is to code everyday and [blog](https://frenk.me) about my progress.

## Specs
For the next 100 days that I code, I will blog and share a repo of what I did that day.
